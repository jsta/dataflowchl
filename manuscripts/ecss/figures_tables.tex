Polygons represent variability in sampling location over the course of the study period. a) Underway grab sampling network (1993-2015): RL = Rankin Lake, WB = Whipray Basin, TB = Terrapin Bay, ML = Monroe Lake, 7P = Seven Palm Lake, MD = Madeira Bay, LM = Little Madeira Bay, P5 = Pond Five, JB = Joe Bay, LG = Long Sound, BW = Blackwater Sound, LS = Lake Surprise, MB = Manatee Bay, BS = Barnes Sound; b) Representative track line of a Dataflow survey; c) Long-term grab sampling network (2008-2015): BB – Biscayne Bay, FBE – Florida Bay East, FBC = Florida Bay Central.}

The center line of each box is the median of the data, the height of the box represents the interquartile range, and the whiskers represent the fifth and 95th percentiles. }
