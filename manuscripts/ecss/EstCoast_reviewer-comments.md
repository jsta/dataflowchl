## Reviewer #1: ESCO-D-17-00063
Fine-scale relationships between phytoplankton abundance and
environmental drivers in Florida Bay, USA

### Summary
This manuscript reports the results of water monitoring in Florida Bay
that highlights continuous mapping of water characteristics. Continuous
mapping was conducted 3 or 4 times per year from 2008 to 2015 using a
flow-through system. The system allowed rapid measurement of
fluorescent compounds and allowed grab samples to be collected while
underway. The data from this period was compared with a longer-term
grab sampling record that extended from 1993 to 2015. Results showed
that central Florida Bay had higher chlorophyll a than Barnes Sound and
the eastern Bay; chlorophyll concentration declined in the central Bay
over the long-term record. Periodic chlorophyll increases were found in
2009 and 2012 in the central Bay. Localized areas with transient
periods of increased chlorophyll were found that were not represented
in the long-term record. The study also found a correlation between
chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus, total phosphorus,
orthophosphate, and total
nitrogen. 

### General Comments
**This study provides a rich dataset on the spatial distribution of
fluorescent compounds in Florida Bay and a potentially useful
comparison with spatially-discrete grab samples. However, the analyses do not sufficiently address the questions the study set out in the introduction on lines 49-54. No statistical analysis was performed to define the spatial representativeness of a point measurement; no statistical analysis was performed to identify the shapes of water quality boundaries; no statistical analysis was performed to assess the influence of a point source on spatial area of the water quality signal it affected. 
Instead, the data were described qualitatively and the
original questions are left unanswered. The lack of quantitative
testing of the data also restricts the transferability of findings to
other estuarine systems where these questions apply. Ultimately, the
conclusions of the current study only confirm what has previously been
reported in Florida Bay; no new
information was presented that alters or significantly updates the
current knowledge of Florida Bay.**

*Thank you for the very thorough and thoughtful review. In response to your comments we have added a quantitative analysis of the severity of water quality boundaries. Also, we have reduced our emphasis on assessing the influence of point source discharge on water quality signals. We felt this was beyond the scope of the present paper. In addition to our novel analysis of water quality boundaries, we feel that the details of our map generation technique as well as our findings related to the relative importance of various optical parameters represents novel and valuable contributions to Florida Bay science.*

**A hypothesis is stated very loosely on line 58 but not referred to
again until line 194. However, no quantitative definition of "sharp
water quality boundary" was given, and therefore the hypothesis could
not be tested.**

*We have added a sub-section detailing our methods for identifying water quality boundaries. We now evalute our hypothesis in the first paragraph of the Discussion section.*

**I think the authors missed two opportunities for valuable data analysis that could have advanced applied and theoretical questions in estuarine science. First, the dataset seems to provide an excellent opportunity for comparing how management based on spatially-continuous data mapping may differ from management based on discrete, point sampling. What are estuarine ecosystem assessments potentially missing if they rely on discrete, point sampling? Are general conclusions on the ecosystem status of Florida Bay fundamentally different if we rely on discrete, point sampling? Under what conditions is spatial mapping required, and when? These are the applications referred to in the last sentence of the manuscript, but could have been the first questions addressed and resolved with the data collected.**

*We feel that our results show that discrete sampling occurs on a scale which is too coarse to resolve the effects of individual water management actions (e.g. control structure operation). We have added text to the discussion detailing our thoughts on this topic. Overall, we felt that the primary focus of this paper was to test for water quality boundaries and identify their location and severity rather than evaluation of management alternatives.*

**This study also missed the opportunity to investigate a theoretical
question that the authors allude to but do not develop: how do you
define a "boundary" in water quality condition, and how are these
boundaries perpetuated over time? The abstract and discussion claim
that these boundaries were examined, but the study does not use any
quantitative method to define what a boundary is.**

*This is an excellent question and definitely motivated our analysis. We have developed a method for quantitively assessing boundaries. We explain our definition of a boundary in a new methods sub-section.*

### Specific Comments

**Line 100: TSS and turbidity data are not provided in the manuscript.**

*References to this data have been removed*

**Line 153: What is the quantitative distinction between a diffuse and
sharp boundary? Again, the lack of a definition and subsequent
statistical test prevents the authors from testing the hypothesis
mentioned in the introduction and on line 194.**

*We have added a quantitative analysis of boundary severity. Rather than developing an arbitrary threshold beyond which constitutes a boundary, we compute the cumulative distribution of boundaries for each survey.*

**line 281: It is not clear what "framework" is being referred to:
Dataflow, interpolation, regression between chlorophyll and optical
properties? I'm not convinced that this framework addressed any of the
questions raised in the introduction or discussion.**

*We were referring to the combination of all the elements referenced in this comment. We have added clarifing text to this section. We feel that our mapping procedure, in contrast to the alternative procedure (discrete point sampling), was able to address our primary questions: Do water quality boundaries exist? If so, where are they and how severe are they?*

*Panel identification has been added to the caption*

**Table 2: Sample size needs to be identified in the table.**

*Sample size has been added to the table.*

## Reviewer #2

Review of Stachelek et al. “Fine-scale relationships between phytoplankton abundance and environmental drivers in Florida Bay, USA”

The ability to resolve fine-scale spatial variability of phytoplankton biomass can help elucidate important physical and biological drivers of pelagic productivity. In this study, the author’s used a flow through system equipped with fluorometric instrumentation to map the in vivo fluorescence of chlorophyll a, the cyanobacterial accessory pigments phycocyanin and phycoerythrin, and CDOM fluorescence. Regressions of these fluorescent properties were then regressed against chlorophyll a values determined using standard filtration, extraction, and fluorometric analyses from samples collected along each Dataflow survey line. Regressions were then used to estimate chlorophyll a along each Dataflow survey line. Spatial maps of interpolated chlorophyll a estimations were generated using a recently developed algorithm that interpolates based on connectivity of water parcels rather than solely on distance.  Using this approach the authors documented strong gradients in chlorophyll between the lagoons in the north of Florida Bay and the main parts of the Bay. They did not observe hypothesized strong gradients between regions of the central Bay that are separated by shallow mud banks. They also observed small regions of elevated chlorophyll a along the eastern side of Florida Bay where septic inputs might be locally significant nutrient sources. In addition to the spatial mapping work, the author’s correlated phytoplankton biomass with N and P species to investigate the role of nutrients in determining phytoplankton biomass. As has been previously observed, phytoplankton biomass correlated most strongly with particulate phosphorus.  

**There is not a lot of new information provided in the study. As the author’s mention several time, their study primarily confirmed previous findings. I think a more detailed description of the post-calibration component of the study would add a significant degree of novelty. For example, under what conditions did phycocyanin better predict chla than chla in vivo?
Analyses and discussion of how seasonality, salinity, precipitation, different regions within the Bay, or other conditions affected the ability to estimate chlorophyll a from the Dataflow fluorescence signatures could also be added.**

*Thank you for the very helpful comments. We have added text detailing when (and under what conditions) phycocyanin was a better predictor of chla than in vivo chla. Also, we have added text giving our interpretation on the ecological signficance of our finding that in vivo chla was rarely selected as an important variable at the same time as phycocyanin.*

Overall, the manuscript is well written and the topics are definitely of interest to the Estuaries and Coasts readership. I suggest accepting the manuscript after adding a more thorough analysis of the factors that control the ability to map chl-a using the fluorescence signatures, and addressing the following items. 

**Throughout the manuscript, data sources (i.e. long-term or underway grab samples, precipitation gage stations, etc.) should be identified.**

*We have added relevant qualifiers to each mention of grab sample results.*

**The current reference format in the text does not conform to that used by Estuaries and Coasts.**

*We have updated the reference format.* 

**Lines 46-49: What makes the intermediate spatial scale more important for managing the ecosystem?**

*The intermediate scale corresponds with individual managment actions such as opening a water control structure. We have added a sentence with further explanation.*

**Line 57: spell out chlorophyll a the first time**

*Changed.*

**It would be nice to see the track line of a representative Data flow survey.**

*A figure showing a representative track line has been added to the Appendix.*

**Lines 99-101. Need references for chlorophyll and nutrient analysis methods. Also should list method detection limits and describe procedures used for dealing with data that were below detection limits.**

*Added a reference for laboratory analysis methods. We did not use data below detection limits.*

**Line 109. It is unclear what you mean by “a logically consistent sign”. In table 2, some of the parameters had both positive and negative coefficients.**

*We checked that coefficients had a logically consistent sign in cases where we had strong prior belief (e.g. the coefficient of chlorophyll fluorescence should be positive). A clarifying statement has been added.*

**Line 115-117. Briefly describe how this method compares to normal inverse distance weighting.**

*We have added text to describing the difference. Our method uses "in-water" path distances as input to interpolation rather than straight line distances. This prevents the interpolations from "bleeding through" land barriers.*
 
**Lines 141-144. If 2 is the cutoff then it occurred a lot more often than just during 2009 and 2012. It also looks like the high biomass occurred during the dry season FOLLOWING particularly wet summers rather than DURING prolonged periods of above-average precipitation.**

*We believe that Figure 2 reflects the statement regarding the 2 ug cutoff. Good suggestion about the timing of high biomass. We have added clarifying text to this effect at this point and at lines 216-218 in the original document.*

**Lines 145-147. Are these from the long-term data set. This needs to be specified in the caption or in the text. Also need to describe box and whiskers in the caption for figure 3.**

*Yes, these are from the long-term data set. We have updated the text to be explicit. We have also added more detail to the figure 3 caption.*

**Lines 164-165. In figure 1 it looks like these lakes have long-term monitoring stations. So, how are they outside the scope of the long-term network?**

*The two sites referenced on these lines are indeed outside of the long-term network. Note how they appear on Figure 1a but not Figure 1b.*

**Line 172- Specify whether this is Spearman’s rho or Pearson’s R?**

*This is Spearman's rho. It is now specified in the text.*

**Lines 195-196- In most estuaries, CDOM is highest when freshwater inputs are greatest. It seems counterintuitive that CDOM would be a more important variable during the dry season. This could be discussed further.**

*We have added a panel to Figure 6 showing the spatial distribution of high CDOM measurements. We have also added discussion of possible reasons why CDOM is only important in the dry season.*

**Line 216-218. I really didn’t see this in the figures. It looked like higher chlorophyll might have occurred during the dry season following a wetter than normal wet season.**

*Good suggestion about the timing of high chlorophyll. We agree and have added clarifying statements to this effect at this point in the paper as well as at lines 141-144 in the original document.*

**Line 219- “cause conditions of high salinity and low dissolved oxygen”. This statement needs a citation.**

*Citation added.*

**Lines 278-280. Where was it shown that chlorophyll hotspots coincided with high CDOM fluorescence?**

*We have added a panel to Figure 6 showing the spatial distribution of high CDOM measurements.*
 
**Figure 2. If separate panels were used for each of the three zone, you might be able to see the change at around 2008 without having to zoom in. The FBC series could have a y-axis limit of 0-10 with the one outlier identified with either a broken axis or just writing the value in near the top of the panel. Are the precipitation values cumulative monthly values? This should be noted in the caption.**

*We have added text to the caption specifying that the values are cumulative monthly totals.*

**Figure 4. This figure needs to be much larger. Also, suggest identifying dates in the form “Aug 2008”. It’s not clear how you decided which twenty of the thirty surveys to include in this figure. Was it based on significance of the regression model? If so, this needs to be stated, and also noted that for 1/3 of the surveys a significant regression model could not be developed? Please specify what is indicated by white areas (e.g. western part of Florida Bay in Feb 2011). Were these not surveyed on that particular date?**

*Figure has been enlarged. Identifying dates have been changed to the suggested format. Yes, we only show chlorophyll surfaces for which we developed a valid regression model. A statement to this effect has been added to the figure caption. We added a note about white areas not being surveyed.*

**Table 1. Specify sample number. Was alpha set at 0.001? This is a high bar for significance. Was ammonium and nitrate data available? If so, they should be included. Nutrient abbreviations should be in all caps to match the table caption.**

*Sample number is now specified in the caption. Alpha was changed to 0.05. Ammonium and nitrate data have been added. Abbreviations have been changed to all caps.*

**Table 2. The different potential variables for the regressions need to be defined. What are there no regression models for some of the dates but insignificant regression models for others? Please specify sample size for each regression. For Feb. 2010, the p-values is listed as 0.13 but the Rsquared value is 0.99.**

*Variable definitions have been added to the caption. There are regression models for all of the dates. The model for Feb. 2010 was refit to fix a problem with multicollinearity. We have dropped panels from Figure 4 that were based on insignificant regression models (Feb 2010). The sample size is now specified.*

**Figure 6. Units of chlorophyll a need to be changed from milligrams/L to micrograms/L.**

*Fixed.*

## Reviewer #3: General comments:

**This manuscript presents high-resolution water quality data from
multiple surveys conducted in Florida Bay.  The dataset has nice
potential to augment existing discrete water quality sampling in the
system, but unfortunately the manuscript is far too descriptive at this
point.  I encourage the authors to spend more time on a big picture
focus for the paper... there is plenty of room, as the paper is only 11
pages currently!  For example, it would be valuable to know what this
sampling approach tells us about the adequacy of discrete sampling
programs in estuaries.  Likewise, little effort was put forth to tell
us how this data augments what we already know (or don't know) about
the ecology of Florida Bay.  Finally, there is potential for this high-
resolution data to be used to increase our understanding of
phytoplankton dynamics in estuaries.**

*Thank you for your kind words and suggestions for improvement. We have added more discussion of how our approach contrasts with discrete sampling designs. We have also added more interpration of the ecological significance of our findings.*

### Specific comments:

**Line 139 - Did you do the statistics to say that this decline is
significant?**

*Average chlorophyll concentrations in the two periods were calculated along with their standard errors. These have been added to the text.*

**Lines 141-143 - Does not look to me as if chlorophyll was less than 2 ug/l in FBC.**

*We believe that chlorophyll is less than 2ug/l in the 2008-2015 period with the exception of 2009 and 2012. This is described on the lines following the statement in question.*

**Lines 143-144 - 2009 and 2012 do not appear to have "above-average"
precipitation compared to other years, according to Fig. 2c.  How did
you decide that this was the case?**

*We realize that judging yearly totals from the monthly plot is not very straight-forward. We have calculated these yearly totals and reported some of them in the text to support this point.*

**Lines 153-154 - Did salinity or temperature show the presence of "sharp
water quality boundaries"?  Perhaps they do, where chlorophyll does
not, owing to different physical-chemical processes driving these
variables?**

*This is a great idea! We have added a series of salinity maps to give an idea of the relative shape of chlorophyll and salinity boundaries. We have also verified the intensity of water quality boundaries in a new quantitative analysis.*

**Lines 156-158 - You could elaborate on this, such as by exploring
whether the sharp boundaries between sub basins changed in response to
environmental forcing.**

*After our quantitative boundary analysis, we found that severe chlorophyll boundaries were more common in periods of high chlorophyll concentration (in the dry season following periods of increased rainfall and watershed export).*

**Lines 165-168 - Do the high chlorophyll levels in Taylor River and Joe
Bay actually represent chlorophyll, or could this be a CDOM
influence?  What does the relationship between Dataflow chlorophyll and
discrete chlorophyll look like in these areas?**

*We cannot completely rule our CDOM interference with the performance of our chlorophyll probes. However, our strategy was to account for potential interference by including CDOM measurements when exploring regression models.*

**Lines 171-172 - I don't put much importance in the chlorophyll and PP
relationship.  Couldn't the high PP actually correspond to cellular
phosphorus, hence a spurious relationship?**

*We agree, this is a possibility. We have de-emphasized this finding by highlighting the strong relationship with total phosphorus. To our knowledge, modelling chlorophyll as a function of total phosphorus (TP) is a common practice. We still include particulate phosphorus in our regression models because our goal is prediction and identification of chlorophyll/water-quality boundaries rather than strict inference about PP.*

**Lines 179-184 - What does the selection of these variables tell
you?  What is the importance?  Elaborate.**

*We have added discussion of our interpretation of the variable selection results in the Discussion section.*

**Lines 188-190 - I think the relationship between chlorophyll and
phosphorus may be spurious.**

*This relationship was very strong in our results and is supported by the results of previous studies.*

**Lines 216-221 - It would be very useful to see plots of salinity (at a
minimum) to accompany the chlorophyll data.  It is hard to interpret
any hydrologic (salinity) influence at this point without seeing that
data.**

*We have added a salinity figure and referenced it to support these statements.*

**Lines 224-228 - It is mentioned that seagrass die-off leads to
phytoplankton blooms, yet in July 2015 when a die-off occurred there is
no phytoplankton bloom.  This seems contradictory.**

*Looks like a bloom to us. There is much higher chlorophyll in the western portion the study period relative to the previous three years.*

**Lines 237-240 - Do you have nutrient data to support these
statements?  Is this even relevant to your study?**

*The support for these statements comes from previous studies which are attached to these lines via citation. We believe that the elevated chlorophyll in the saline lakes are clear outliers. We believe that it is important for us to provide some explanation.*

**Lines 253-256 - This is confusing.**

*We have refactored this section with more detail and a more logical structure.*

**Lines 264-265 - What locations was CDOM important?**

*CDOM was high in the upstream saline lakes. We have added statements and a new panel for Figure 6 to this effect. In addition, we have added more text detailing the importance of CDOM relative to other factors for estimating chlorophyll concentration.* 

**Table 1 & accompanying text - Is there no dissolved inorganic or
organic nitrogen data available?  TN or TP can be anything.**

*We have added a more detailed breakdown of phosphorus and nitrogen species to this table.*
