\section{Appendix}

Interpolated chlorophyll estimates were quantitatively checked against independent DBHYDRO chlorophyll concentrations (Table A1). However, the timing of these measurements did not exactly match the dates of Dataflow surveys. We restricted our quantitative comparisons to surveys when DBHYDRO samples were collected within 4 days from the date of a Dataflow survey. This four day window was chosen because the temporal autocorrelation of salinity data from USGS platforms (Trout Creek) decreases markedly beyond a 3 day lag (Figure A1).

With the exception of October 2009, the root mean squared error of chlorophyll concentration estimates were less than 1 Âµg/L (Table A1). The coefficient of determination (R2) values are low for DBHYDRO versus Dataflow estimated chlorophyll. However, this is a symptom of the low range of chlorophyll concentration. This range is small enough that temporal mismatch (variability) and measurement error are at least as large as the spatial chlorophyll variability.

Chlorophyll maps presented throughout this paper represent the mean prediction from multiple linear regressions using the coefficients presented in Table 2. Figure A2 shows an example of the variation in output between the lower and upper 95\% prediction intervals. Figure A3 and A4 show spatial variation within individuals basins of Florida Bay. There is an indication of a higher chlorophyll "hotspot" in western Joe Bay in 2009, 2013, and 2015 (Figure A3). In addition, there in indication of the scale at which the "plume" from Taylor River extends into Little Madeira Bay (Figure A4).
