Dear Editor, 

We are pleased to re-submit our manuscript entitled “Fine-scale relationships between phytoplankton abundance and environmental drivers in Florida Bay, USA” for potential publication in Estuaries and Coasts. We have made substantial revisions to the paper based on the reviewer comments. Specifically, we have carried out additional analysis to make our discussion of water quality boundaries more quantitative rather than simply descriptive. In addition, we have added more interpretation of our results in light of estuarine phytoplankton dynamics, nutrient cycling, and the importance of using a suite of optical parameters to predict chlorophyll. 

Sincerely, 

Joseph Stachelek
