	shorttitle = {Seasonal and long-term trends in the water quality of {Florida} {Bay} (1989-1997)},
	abstract = {Analysis of 6 yr of monthly water quality data was performed on three distinct zones of Florida Bay: the
eastern bay, central bay, and western bay. Each zone was analyzed for trends at intra-annual (seasonal), interannual
(oscillation), and long-term (monotonic) scales. The variables TON, TOG, temperature, and Thl : TP ratio had seasonal
maxima in the summer rainy season; APA and Chl a, indicators of the size and activity of the n{\textasciitilde}icroplanktonte nded to
have maxima in the fall. In contrast, NO,-, NO,-, NH,+, turbidity, and DO,. were highest in the winter dry season.
There were large changes in some of the water quality variables of Florida Bay over the study period. Salinity and TP
concentrations declined baywide while turbidity increased dramatically. Salinity declined in the eastern, central, and
western Florida Bay by 13.6\%0, ll.6\%0, and 5.6\%0, respectively. Some of the decrease in the eastern bay could be
accounted for by increased freshwater flows from the Everglades. In contrast to most other estuarine systems, increased
runoff may have been partially responsible for the decrease in TP concentrations as input concentrations were 0.3-0.5
pM. Turbidity in the eastern bay increased twofold from 1991 to 1996, while in the central and western bays it increased
by factors of 20 and 4, respectiveiy. Chl a concentrations were particularly dynamic and spatially heterogeneous. In the
eastern bay, which makes up roughly half of the surface area of Florida Bay, Chl a declined by 0.9 yg 1-I (63\%). The
hydrographically isolated central bay zone underwent a fivefold increase in phytoplankton biorn{\textasciitilde}assf rom 1989 to 1994,
then rapidly declined to previous levels by 1996. In western Florida Bay there was a significant increase in Chl a, yet
median concentrations of Chl a in the water column remained modest (-2 pg 1-I) by most estuarine standards. Only in
the central bay did the DIN pool increase substantially (threefold to sixfold). Notably, these changes in turbidity and
phytoplankton biomass occurred after the poorly-understood seagrass die-off in 1987. It is likely the death and decomposition
of large amounts of seagrass biomass can at least partially explain some of the chaniges in water quality of
Florida Bay, but the connections are temporally disjoint and the processes indirect and not well understood.},
